This application was created to gain practical hands-on experience with logistics.
*Particularly, throughout the development process of my learning,
It was able to teach me several things included within this app features


APP FEATURES:
1. Dashboards - views the general section of the app capability and recent activity that occured within the shipments.
1. Priority Tasks section - emulates daily tasks to be done, focusing initially on shipments that needs the most attention.
2. Emails section - describes the carrier or customer updates tied to shipments.
3. Phone Calls section - simulates a caller(either carrier or customer) regarding their load updates and issues.
4. Live Tracker section - displays all the shipments and their statuses. i.e. in_transit, pending, exception, delivered.
5. Batch Processing section - enables for easy filtering of live shipments to be stored as an archived history.
6. Documents section - shows all related documents such as Bill of Lading(BOD), Proof of Delivery(POD) and Invoice for a selected shipment.
7. Daily Summary section - provides a simple data visualization on the statuses and performance of shipments.


p.s. ~ the application is currently hosted on specified link at hereby repository.
~ the web application is a mock-up data, meaning at each page reload you are presented with various data simulation,
or simply a different shipment scenario from previous ones.
since this is only a simulation of how logistics coordination works, persistence via backend was not implemented,
as it may also depletes unnecessary storage on the only free cloud hosting - Vercel.

~ on a real world logistics case, in oppose to my work. persistence is necessary especially for the
archiving and documentation purpose particularly for shipment status and document relations.
